By: Christian Foote, Drew Mainprize

## Acknowledgement

The sample parser provided for the Tiny programming language
was used as a starting point for this assignment

## Building and cleaning

- Note that Paths for Jflex, Classpath, and CUP may need to 
  be altered to match the path of your machine

To build the parser, type 'make' in the current directory

To clean, type 'make clean' in the current directory

## Running

After running make, this compiler can be run with the command:
The command line option '-a' can be used to print the input files
abstract syntax tree.
The command line option '-s' can be used to enable semantic error
detection and reporting, and display symbol tables.
The command line option '-c' can be used to enable the compilation
and output of TM assembly language code
Multiple flags can be used at once.

java <your classpath> CM TestFiles/<filename>.cm
java <your classpath> CM -a TestFiles/<filename>.cm
java <your classpath> CM -s TestFiles/<filename>.cm
java <your classpath> CM -c TestFiles/<filename>.cm

Test files have been provided, with the name [12345].cm to showcase
various types of errors.
Each test file includes a header describing the errors contained.
